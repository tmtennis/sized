## Project Overview
This is a modern Next.js website for SIZED, a curatorial platform and cultural studio. The project uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and follows the design aesthetic established in the Alexander May portfolio site.

## Design System & Aesthetic
- **Dark Theme**: Pure black backgrounds (#000000), white text
- **Typography**: Inter font family with emphasis on ExtraBold (font-black) for headings
- **Layout**: Clean, minimal, sophisticated spacing
- **Components**: Reusable, accessible, and consistent with the brand aesthetic
- **Animation**: Subtle, elegant transitions and micro-interactions

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Maintain clean, semantic HTML structure
- Use proper accessibility attributes
- Keep components small and focused
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

## Key Components to Maintain
- Header with navigation
- Footer with consistent styling
- Container for content width management
- Typography components with proper hierarchy
- Page layouts that match the established aesthetic

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for components
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use kebab-case for file names and routes
- Be descriptive and consistent with naming
