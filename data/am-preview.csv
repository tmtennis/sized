"Defined by a precise and architectural approach to design. Founded by Alexander May, the studio operates at the meeting point of space, object, and image, where every project is treated as a structure, measured, intentional, and complete. May's career has been shaped by an insistence on clarity and proportion. His work ranges from interiors and exhibitions to furniture and curatorial projects, always returning to the same principles: a disciplined use of material, a deep engagement with scale, and a refusal of excess. The studio's ethos is rooted in authorship. Projects are not styled but built, approached with the rigour of architecture and the sensibility of art. Light, surface, and proportion are not secondary concerns but the foundations of meaning. The results are environments and objects that stand with quiet authority, at once minimal and resonant. Alexander May Studio works across disciplines yet maintains a singular vision: to create forms that are exact, enduring, and unembellished, where nothing is arbitrary and every decision carries weight."
