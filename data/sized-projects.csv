PROJECT,DATE,DESCRIPTION
frieze-los-angeles,03/03/2024,"For Frieze Los Angeles 2024, SIZED presented SIZED SELECTS, a site-specific installation that engaged with Los Angeles car culture through a sculptural and curatorial lens. The exhibition took place within the former Howard Hughes headquarters, with a parallel activation at The West Hollywood EDITION, where a fleet of all-black automobiles was recontextualized as formal objects in a gallery-like setting.

Curated under the direction of Alexander May with contributions from Damon Jones, the presentation assembled vehicles spanning multiple eras, from rare vintage models to contemporary icons. The selection included a 1993 Vector W8, a 1982 Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible, a 2002 Porsche 911 GT2, and a 1993 Mercedes 500SEC AMG, among others. Rendered in a single monochromatic palette, the cars were reduced to pure silhouette, line, and proportion, foregrounding their sculptural qualities.
In collaboration with designer Willo Perron, SIZED produced a 65-foot custom table and eighty transparent chairs for USM Modular Furniture, establishing a spatial framework that anchored the installation in architectural rhythm and communal scale.

By night, the exhibition shifted into a dining environment in partnership with culinary collective We Are Ona. Draped silk partially veiled the automobiles, heightening shadow and contour, and transforming the setting into an immersive stage for a series of intimate dinners.

SIZED SELECTS reflected Los Angeles’ enduring relationship with the automobile, serving as both a meditation on engineering and a study of movement, material, and monochrome as defining visual languages."
antimatiere,10/16/2023,"Curated by SIZED for the inaugural edition of CONTRIBUTIONS, Antimatière presented a focused body of new work by Studio HAOS alongside selected pieces by Omer Arbel, Rich Aybar, and Katerina Jebb. Staged during Paris Art and Design Week, the exhibition explored material austerity and sculptural intent through a dialogue of form and process.

Studio HAOS introduced eight new works constructed entirely from 40 x 40 aluminium tubing and zinc sheet, a deliberate departure from mechanised production and ornamental craft. The reductive framework foregrounded material and method as vehicles for philosophical and formal investigation.

The installation was complemented by Omer Arbel’s 71, a suspended electrochemical sculpture; Rich Aybar’s resin forms addressing corporeal abstraction; and Katerina Jebb’s large-scale photographic prints, derived from high-resolution scans of culturally resonant objects.

Set within a restrained environment, Antimatière framed these works in a shared vocabulary of discipline, abstraction, and contemporary ritual, extending SIZED’s curatorial practice into the fabric of Paris’ art and design landscape."
dries-van-noten,05/03/2023,"SIZED temporarily occupied Dries Van Noten’s Los Angeles arts space and adjacent retail store to present BOND, a two-month exhibition informed by the Japanese art of Ikebana. Conceived as an exploration of tension and harmony between objects and environment, the project treated placement as a sculptural act and space itself as a medium.

A considered selection of works by artists and designers was arranged with principles of restraint and balance, establishing a rhythm that unfolded across both exhibition and retail interiors. The store was subtly reimagined to echo the atmosphere of the installation, creating a dialogue between the two sites.

The project extended across multiple forms of expression. Printed matter, digital materials, and environmental details were conceived to sustain the tone of the exhibition at every point of encounter. BOND concluded with a gathering hosted in collaboration with Yola Mezcal and Aplós, drawing together artists, designers, and creative communities in a closing moment of exchange."
in-motion,12/09/2022,"Curated by SIZED, In Motion: Andy Warhol 1974–1986 was a three-day exhibition presented at SIZED STUDIO in Los Angeles in December 2022. The inaugural project for the space, it introduced the programme with an intimate presentation of rare black-and-white film portraits by Andy Warhol.

The exhibition featured forty photographs taken between 1974 and 1986, several of which had not been previously shown. The works captured Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, William S. Burroughs, Bianca Jagger, and others from Warhol’s circle, revealing informal and transitional moments that reflected the artist’s closeness to his subjects.
Conceived as a meditation on movement and creative process, In Motion marked both a cultural touchpoint and the beginning of SIZED STUDIO’s programme, positioning the site as a place for reflection, experimentation, and dialogue."
antionio-fortelioni,06/07/2022,"or Salone del Mobile 2022, SIZED collaborated with architect and designer Antonio Forteleoni on a weeklong installation that unfolded across the street-facing windows of his Milan studio. Presented continuously for 168 hours, the work shifted in illumination from dusk to dawn, inviting visitors to engage in an extended rhythm of light, material, and form.

The exhibition introduced seven new pieces by Forteleoni: four lamps, a table, a vase, and a stool. Each was fabricated in Sardinia from single sheets of hot-dip galvanised steel, employing a process of subtraction and reassembly that merged prehistoric symbolism with architectural clarity. The silhouettes drew on the language of Nuragic sculpture while imagining its future iterations.

The use of galvanised steel echoed the work of Jacques Couelle, whose sculptural residences punctuate the Sardinian coastline, as well as Isamu Noguchi, whose final body of work in Los Angeles engaged with similar materials and finishes. Each piece was patinated with water from the Mediterranean Sea, grounding the works in Forteleoni’s native landscape.

Operating as a quiet architectural gesture, the installation brought together regional memory, material experimentation, and personal lineage in a public-facing format."
industrialism,05/19/2022,"resented by SIZED at Donna Karan’s UrbanZen in the West Village, INDUSTRIALISM examined how material, process, and production shape our relationship to objects in a time defined by shifting supply chains and evolving access to raw resources. The exhibition reflected on the aesthetics and politics of making, asking what it means to produce, what is available to be used, and how material carries meaning in both function and form.

Spanning two floors and featuring over one hundred works, INDUSTRIALISM assembled nearly fifty artists, designers, dealers, and galleries from across the world. The presentation traversed painting, archival design, sound sculpture, photography, lighting, and automotive design, creating a layered investigation into industrial craft and collectible design.

The exhibition was accompanied by the Mortlach by Design Lounge, a dedicated space developed in collaboration with Mortlach Whisky. Bespoke Mortlach objects were placed in dialogue with selected works from the exhibition, forming a contextual retreat that hosted private gatherings, including a Frieze Art Fair brunch and a VIP opening celebration.

As SIZED’s first exhibition in New York, INDUSTRIALISM marked a pivotal moment in its programme, bringing together a wide spectrum of voices in a shared conversation on access, intention, and the evolving nature of production."
vessels,2/16/2022,"Presented at the newly established SIZED STUDIO in Hollywood, VESSELS was an exhibition dedicated to the vessel as a form of poetic function. Spanning 7,000 square feet across two floors, the presentation gathered more than two hundred works by artists, designers, architects, and studios from around the world. Contributions ranged from vases and planters to furniture and abstract sculpture, creating a survey that expanded the definition of the vessel beyond container to include objects that hold not only matter, but also space, presence, and ritual.

The installation paired vessels with botanical arrangements, where branch clusters and floral compositions animated the works and underscored their connection to use and ceremony. Familiar forms were revisited as both functional and sculptural, reflecting shared ideas of purpose, aesthetic, and continuity.

As Alexander May noted, the project sought to renew dialogue with an archetypal form: “When viewed in conjunction with the floral installation, the personality in each piece responds to the Sōgetsu school’s philosophy on genuine thinking and diverse creativity.”

In parallel, SIZED partnered with the Paris-based NFT platform CONCEPT on a limited release of ten digital editions derived from works featured in the exhibition. Participating artists included Emmanuel Olunkwa, Vanessa Beecroft, RA Workshop (Rich Aybar), Lukas Stoever, Rio Estudio, Illya Goldman Gubin, Marc Leschalier, Grace Prince, Klaus Jürgen Schmidt, and Tino Seubert. The collaboration extended the project into both physical and digital dimensions, framing the vessel as a form in continuous evolution."
619-north-western-avenue,6/15/2021,"For its inaugural exhibition, SIZED convened a global group of artists, designers, dealers, and collectors in a site-specific installation within a converted theatre in Los Angeles. Developed around a conceptual glossary that included terms such as “vessel,” “mineral,” “useful,” and “sustain,” the project positioned site as medium and object as aura, shaping a spatial encounter rooted in both material and meaning.

The installation employed the stage as a framework for display. Works were presented on industrial steel decks at a unified height, forming a continuous plane where objects could be encountered without hierarchy or imposed sequence. Visitors moved freely through the space, navigating a landscape of works that encouraged open interpretation.
Objects on view included couture sculpture by Sterling Ruby / S.R. STUDIO. LA. CA., performance-worn instruments from Lykke Li, furniture by Luka Sabbat, a Gallic chair by Michèle Lamy for Rick Owens Furniture, hand-crafted garments by No Sesso, and terracotta head vases by Casa Ahorita. The Indigenous women–led nonprofit CIELO contributed its publication Dižà Nó Ole, extending the exhibition into broader cultural dialogue.

Presented within SIZED STUDIO, the exhibition introduced the platform’s curatorial philosophy through form, placement, and collaboration, establishing the foundation for its ongoing programme."
